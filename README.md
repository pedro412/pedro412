I have work on different projects of my own making websites and small apps as a freelance using JavaScript/TypeScript as the main programing language, i have build Restfuls API's with Express, Nest, Hapi, sometimes also with .NET Core with Databases such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or MySQL.
